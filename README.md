# E-commerce Dataset

This repository contains an e-commerce dataset intended for learning purposes. The dataset includes various information related to e-commerce transactions, products, customers, and more.

## Contents

- Events: This dataset captures various activities and interactions across different platforms or services. Each entry represents a specific event, such as a user action or system-triggered event.

- Events History (events_hist): A historical archive of events, storing past data from the main events dataset. It serves as a repository for tracking event evolution over time for audit or analysis purposes.

- Events Raw (events_raw): Contains the raw, unprocessed event data. This dataset is the initial capture of event information before any transformations, filtering, or cleaning are applied.

- Events Update (events_update): Stores updated event records that have been modified or corrected from the original dataset. It is useful for managing changes in the event data over time.

- Items: This dataset lists all products or services available within the system. It includes unique identifiers and key attributes such as name, category, and pricing details for each item.

- Sales: Contains records of transactions related to product or service sales. Each entry represents a completed sale and includes details such as item sold, quantity, price, and time of purchase.

- Sales History (sales_hist): A historical log of sales transactions, preserving past records from the sales dataset. It ensures that sales data is available for long-term analysis and reporting.

- Transactions: Represents individual financial or operational transactions, capturing details such as transaction ID, date, amounts, and related entities. This dataset serves as the primary source of transactional data.

- Users: Contains user profile information, storing key details about individuals who interact with the system. It includes identifiers, names, contact information, and other relevant attributes.

- Users History (users_hist): A historical dataset that archives user data over time, tracking changes to user profiles. It provides a complete view of past and present user information.

- Users Update (users_update): Stores user profile updates, capturing modifications or corrections to existing user data. This dataset helps manage the evolution of user profiles across the system.
